* Thanks and Attribution

The bulk of the trivia file was taken from the [Lore of
Nuffle](http://loreofnuffle.talkfantasyfootball.org/) where many of the
sourcebook tidbits has been compiled (along with additions.)  Many thanks to
Ithilkir of TalkFantasyFootball forums for putting that together (along with
Khenian and Torpor of same).  I tried to get a hold of Ithilkir at the forums
however the site would not mail me the "email verification" after several
attempts so I have given up for now.  Hopefully attribution will be sufficient!
Also many thanks to Games Workshop for a fun tactical (and silly) football
variant!
